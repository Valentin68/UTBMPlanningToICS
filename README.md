## Script description ##
UTBMPlanningToICS aims to simplify classes planning understanding for UTBM's students (UTBM = University of Technology of Belfort-Montbeliard). More precisely, this python script allows all UTBM students to turn the unformatted list of courses (which can be found on [their personnal space](https://monespace.utbm.fr/)) into a proper ICS file they can directly import on their favourite schedule utility, like Google Agenda for example.
